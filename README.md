# Automated_SDR_to_Google_Sheets_R

Original credit for this work goes to Tim Wilson at Search Discovery.  His repository is here: https://github.com/gilliganondata.  I've adapted this to where you can automate your SDR into a daily refreshing google sheet for Adobe Analytics, and also have included a Google Analytics vs Adobe Analytics comparison of the last 90 days as a companion.

Look for the .ROUT files if you have any problems with running automation in Windows- it is a nice little debug log when things go wrong.  

Once you get these running fully- check to make sure the Google Sheets are in your drive, then automate, and lastly- use import ranges to some master google sheet with them all together and some nice little graphs to keep a close eye on your adobe and google analytics implementations.  Better to be safe than sorry!  Credit for the pivotal R packages goes to Randy Zwitch with RSiteCatalyst and Mark Edmundson for the Google Analytics and Google Auth Packages!  Boo-yah!

Bonus add to this Repo:  If you use the Adobe Analytics Health Dashboard- and you know how to use macros and VBA, you can automate those as well with a vbs script and batch file.  Basically, you want to label
